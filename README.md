- Build an API server with one of the following languages: Python, Go, Ruby on Rails, JS.
- The API server has to have a token based authentication.
- The API server only needs to have one endpoint that receives an array of URLs. Each of these URLs contain an image.
- The URLs need to be stored.
- The server should have a background process that takes the stored URLs, downloads and processes the binaries (reading the MIME type is sufficient for now).
