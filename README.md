# Nikolay Rys' test task for Voima
## Requirements

- Build an API server with one of the following languages: Python, Go, Ruby on Rails, JS.
- The API server has to have a token based authentication.
- The API server only needs to have one endpoint that receives an array of URLs. Each of these URLs contain an image.
- The URLs need to be stored.
- The server should have a background process that takes the stored URLs, downloads and processes the binaries (reading the MIME type is sufficient for now).

## Installation and Usage                  
```
bundle install
bin/rake db:create
bin/rake db:schema:load
bin/rake jobs:work
bin/rails s
```

## My comments
The task was pretty fun, I think i've covered all the requirements.
Naturally, there were some assumptions and limitations that I didn't cover.
For example, if I had more time, or this would be a real-world product, I would do the following:

- Configure the production environment, right now it's tested on development.
- Consider using a different storage engine, like Postgres and Redis
- Add expiration time to the JWT tokens
â€“ Properly stub the HTTP requests in the tests
- Consider using different background processing libraries
- Add pepper to password hashing, since bcrypt doesn't do it by default
- Validate urls before storing them
- Filter out urls that already have been processed(I'm skipping them down the line for now, in the background job)
- Consider rate limiting to not let use the API as a DOS attack machine
